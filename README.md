# Patterns Vs Churn

This repository is to aid in the replication of the paper "Are Java Files that Implement Software Design Patterns Associated with Reduced Churn?"
It does NOT hold all of the files from the projects – those can be obtained by downloading them from the project repositories and rolling them back
to the dates when the jars were published.

Code can be made available upon request to Benjynstrauss@gmail.com
